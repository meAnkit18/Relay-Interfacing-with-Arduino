# Relay-Interfacing-with-Arduino
This project demonstrates how to interface a relay module with an Arduino to control high-voltage appliances safely. The setup involves using a relay as a switch, allowing the Arduino to control devices such as lights, fans, or other electrical equipment.

Features:
Hardware components: Arduino, relay module, jumper wires, and external power source
Code: Arduino code for controlling the relay based on sensor input or a manual switch
Applications: Home automation, IoT projects, and smart control systems
Safety considerations: Safe handling of high-voltage devices with proper insulation and use of relays
Getting Started:
Circuit Diagram: Simple connections to control the relay from digital pins on the Arduino
Code: Detailed explanations and examples included in the repository
